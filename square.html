      <p>In this challenge we are to create a box that is split into 9 different parts with different colors so that they are all next to each other. The most important part of this experiment would be to use the div class and be able to put colors and change the size so that they are the same. Some strange things that happened to me was that I forgot to make it to link to CSS foldier and instead ended up putting the same style onto each and every thing and being able to use the float command to be able to make it so that they align next to each other. Also another problem was that the floats kept overlapping everything so then the way to do it is it set it equal to three rows and make the flex command, which will make it so that it is confined in that space.</p>
