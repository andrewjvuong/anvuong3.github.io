<br>
<h3>ME</h3>
<p>
I am doomed and ashamed
<br>
I wonder about my grades in the future
<br>
I hear my mom about to yell at me
<br>
I see my mom's red flushed face
<br>
I want to get good grades
<br>
I am doomed and ashamed
</p>
<p>
I pretend that I'm smart
<br>
I feel the grades rising
<br>
I touch the wonderful A's
<br>
I worry that this is not true
<br>
I cry that it really is not true
<br>
I am doomed and ashamed
</p>
<p>
I understand that I'm not really doomed
<br>
I say that to make myself have lwoer self esteem
<br>
I dream that I'll eventually get good grades
<br>
I try
</p>
