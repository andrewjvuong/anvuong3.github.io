<h1> My "I am" poem</h1>

<h3>ME</h3>
<p>
I am doomed and ashamed
<br>
I wonder about my grades in the future
<br>
I hear my mom about to yell at me
<br>
I see my mom's red flushed face
<br>
I want to get good grades
<br>
I am doomed and ashamed
</p>
<p>
I pretend that I'm smart
<br>
I feel the grades rising
<br>
I touch the wonderful A's
<br>
I worry that this is not true
<br>
I cry that it really is not true
<br>
I am doomed and ashamed
</p>
<p>
I understand that I'm not really doomed
<br>
I say that to make myself have lwoer self esteem
<br>
I dream that I'll eventually get good grades
<br>
I try my best
<br>
But I don't succeed
</p>

<h1>Square Challenge</h1>
<p>In this challenge we are to create a box that is split into 9 different parts with different colors so that they are all next to each other. The most important part of this experiment would be to use the div class and be able to put colors and change the size so that they are the same. Some strange things that happened to me was that I forgot to make it to link to CSS foldier and instead ended up putting the same style onto each and every thing and being able to use the float command to be able to make it so that they align next to each other. Also another problem was that the floats kept overlapping everything so then the way to do it is it set it equal to a big fat box.</p>
